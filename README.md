commute.rb
==========

Command-line application to send an SMS alert if traffic on a particular route exceeds a threshold.

##Raison d'Ãªtre
I'm enjoying a commute that occasionally takes 1.5-2x the expected duration.  I put the alert in a cron job so that I can just stay a bit late instead of getting stuck in traffic.

##Requires
A Twilio account
A Bing Maps API key

##Usage

    Usage: commute.rb [options]
        -f, --from SOURCE                Specifies the number to send the SMS from
        -t, --to DESTINATION             Specifies the number to send the SMS to
        -a, --pointa ADDRESS             Specifies the starting address (e.g. 1500 Market Street Philadelphia PA)
        -b, --pointb ADDRESS             Specifies the ending address (e.g. 160 N Gulph Rd King of Prussia PA)
        -d, --duration DURATION          Specifies the commute threshold in minutes. No message will be sent unless threshold is exceeded.

A crontab entry like this one will send an alert at 5:30

    30 17 * * 1-5 /path/to/commute.rb -t '+19175551212' -a '1500 market street, philadelphia, pa' -b '160 N Gulph Rd, King of Prussia, PA' -d

##Known Bugs / Problems
There is absolutely no error handling in the app.  It's quick, dirty, and I only scanned the API docs.
